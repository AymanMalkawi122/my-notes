## Fundamentals summary

1. Understand the importance of software
2. You must have full comprehension of the platform you are using and the project you are working on
3. You should always simplify your code but that should not affect maintainability and functionality (**[code refactoring](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwikl62Ji6T9AhVWRaQEHb0vAggQFnoECBEQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techtarget.com%2Fsearchapparchitecture%2Fdefinition%2Frefactoring%23%3A~%3Atext%3DRefactoring%2520is%2520the%2520process%2520of%2Caltering%2520the%2520code%27s%2520external%2520behavior.&usg=AOvVaw24FSsTWd9pZ1jtEaOp7Eao) must always be done**)
